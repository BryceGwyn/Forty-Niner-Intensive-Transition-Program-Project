# Forty-Niner-Intensive-Transition-Program-Project
This project was a mid-term like assignment for my Forty-Niner Intensive Transition Program at UNCC.
The goal of the project was to show our understanding of variables, expressions, user input, assignment statements and conditionals.
In the assignment, we were to Prompt the user to enter the package number and the number of hours that were used on a streaming platform and calculate a customer's monthly bill
